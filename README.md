The homework assignment to create a simple version of pokemon

Along with the required specs, I include an item feature and move class.
In hindsight, I shouldve converted some of my code into methods in classes rather than accessing the class variables, which I did a lot, but it gets the job done.

One catch I noticed, while running the code through various platforms is that you can see the grid properly on IDE like pycharm or vscode, but won't show on standard terminals.

The homework assignment to create a simple version of pokemon

Along with the required specs, I include an item feature and move class.
In hindsight, I shouldve converted a lot of my code into methods in classes rather than accessing the class variables trhough the objects, which I did a lot, but it gets the job done. I will use this assignment as a lesson. 

One catch I noticed, while running the code through various platforms is that you can see the grid properly on IDE like pycharm or vscode, but won't show on my windows powershell. I suspect the reason is because of the emoji encoding. pycharm doesn't ouput color for the emoji, but vscode luckily outputs color, which I used for my video.
